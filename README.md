# 🍦 Ice Cream Predictor AI

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts whether a person likes ice cream based on their age. It uses a logistic regression model to classify preferences.

---

## 📊 What It Does

Given a person's age, the AI predicts:
- ✅ Likes Ice Cream
- ❌ Doesn’t Like Ice Cream

---

## 🧠 Tech Used

- Python
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- Google Colab
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. We train the AI with age and preference data:

Example:  Age: [5, 12, 25, 40, 60] Likes Ice Cream: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]


2. The model learns the pattern using logistic regression.

3. You can test new ages like 8, 20, 45, or 70 — and the model will predict their ice cream preference.

## 📈 Visualization

The AI’s prediction curve is plotted using `matplotlib` to show confidence across different ages.
